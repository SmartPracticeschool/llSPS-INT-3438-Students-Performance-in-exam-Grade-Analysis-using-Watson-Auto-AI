* ## Introduction:
  Wind speed/power has received increasing attention around the earth due to its renewable nature as well as environmental               friendliness. With the global installed wind power capacity rapidly increasing, the wind industry is growing into a large-scale         business. Reliable short-term wind speed forecasts play a practical and crucial role in wind energy conversion systems, such as the     dynamic control of wind turbines and power system scheduling. A precise forecast needs to overcome problems of variable energy         production caused by fluctuating weather conditions. Power generated by wind is highly dependent on the wind speed. Though it is       highly non-linear, wind speed follows a certain pattern over a certain period of time. We exploit this time series pattern to gain     useful information and use it for power prediction.

* ## Project Description:
  With the wide usage of computers and internet, there has recently been a huge increase in publicly available data that can be
  analysed. Be it online sales information, website traffic, or user habits, data is generated every day. Such a large amount of data
  presents both a problem and an opportunity. The problem is that it is difficult for humans to analyse such large data. The 
  opportunity is that this type of data is ideal for computers to process, because it is stored digitally in a well-formatted way, and 
  computers can process data much faster than humans. In schools and higher educational institutes, many students have to struggle hard 
  to pass exams since there is no dedicated support offered to students who need special attention in the relevant courses.
  This thesis examines the application of machine learning algorithms to predict whether a student will be successful or not. Machine
  learning techniques can be utilized for studentsâ€™ grades prediction in different courses. Such techniques would help students to 
  improve their performance based on predicted grades and would enable instructors to identify such individuals who might need 
  assistance in the courses. This is best suited for online courses.
    ### Solution:
     Our aim is to map weather data to energy production. We wish to show that even data that is publicly available for weather              stations close to wind farms can be used to give a       good prediction of the energy output. Furthermore, we examine the impact      of different weather conditions on the energy output of wind farms. We are building an IBM Watson         AutoAI Machine Learning      technique to predict the energy output of wind turbine. The model is deployed on IBM cloud to get scoring end point which can be        used as API in mobile     app or web app building. We are developing a web application which is built using node red service. We        make use of the scoring end point to give user input values to the           deployed model. The model prediction is then              showcased on User Interface to predict the energy output of wind turbine

* ## Conclusion
  We started with the aim of improving the predictions of power generated using wind energy and we have achieved that using LSTM as       machine learning model and performing model optimization on it. We have also observed that if the wind speed is less than 4 m/s the     power generated by the system is zero. LSTM is not able to learn this pattern as this is not the part which it can understand in time   series analysis. So, if a hybrid new model is created which can work as the combination of Decision Tree/Random Forest and LSTM we     can improve upon these results as well.
